# This is a separate Dockerfile for building the unregistry image for e2e tests using Docker-in-Docker (DinD).
# testcontainers uses legacy build process without BuildKit, so it doesn't pass BUILDPLATFORM as build argument.
# As a result, it fails if a Dockerfile contains a stage with `FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM ...` directive.

# Native build of unregistry for the Docker-in-Docker image. I couldn't make testcontainers to pass BUILDPLATFORM
# to builder-cross, so this is a workaround for e2e tests.
